jadaj - Circular - 2020

Circular is a novel app designed to competitively motivate engineers, mathletes and anyone else to better improve their freehand sketching for the sake of fame, glory and a sense of self-satisfaction. Our app allows users to take an image of their hand drawn shapes and receive automatically generated feedback on the ideality of their submission and ways to improve.
